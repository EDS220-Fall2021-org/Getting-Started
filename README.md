# EDS220_Fall2021

Welcome to EDS 220, Fall 2021! This repository contains the information you'll need to get set up for the exercises we'll do in class during Week 1. 
- Note: Although I've set this up as a Github Classrooms 'assignment', it's not part of your grade - just highly recommended to complete in order to save yourself some headaches during class!

Once your Jupyter install and GEE environments are set up, make sure you can get a basic (blank) map to display using the notebook "GEE_Setup.ipynb".
